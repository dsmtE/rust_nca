## Formatting

The rustfmt tool reformats your code according to the community code style and the rustfmt.tom configuration file.

For the latest and greatest rustfmt, nightly is required.

You first need to install [nightly](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html#working-with-nightly-rust) toolchain.

Then, to run it in the current working directory:
```bash
cargo +nightly fmt
```
